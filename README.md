🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection
📘 Project Title:
Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Machine Learning

📂 Project Code:
PRCP-1001

📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects and classifies diseases in rice leaves using image data. The tool can assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying early signs of plant diseases to enable timely intervention and improve crop yield.

🧠 Objectives
Load and preprocess image data of rice leaves.

Train machine learning/deep learning models for disease classification.

Evaluate model performance and visualize results.

Provide predictions on new/unseen leaf images.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📁 Dataset
The dataset used includes labeled images of healthy and diseased rice leaves (e.g., Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, Bacterial Leaf Blight). It is typically sourced from platforms like Kaggle or Mendeley Data.

Note: Please refer to the notebook for details on dataset loading and preprocessing.

🧪 Features
Image loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
